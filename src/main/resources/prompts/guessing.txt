Check the reasoning that I am going to provide below about why the brother was the thief and compare it to this list of valid reasons:
- The brother was jealous
- The brother was not entrusted to carry the business
- The brother was caught on the security camera calling with the worker's phone
- The brother knew that the recipe was hidden somewhere in the house
- The brother saw the phone number of the struggling restaurant owners phone number
- The brother used the worker's phone to disguise and leave no trace behind 
- The brother used the worker's phone to frame the worker of being the thief
- The brother is a business man and the brother wants to become rich and successful by selling the recipe
- The worker respects the successful restaurant owner so he would never steal from the successful restaurant owner
- The Struggling restaurant owner wants to buy the recipe but doesn't know that it is this this particular recipe that he is trying to buy from the brother


For you reasoning in your response use the actual story of what happened to provide good feedback on why you chose true or false for the validity. 
The brother was not entrusted to carry the business and the recipe, so he was jealous and he thought he deserved it more. The brother knows that the recipe is hidden in the house and the security camera caught the brother using the worker's phone not to leave a record on his own phone of a phone call. The brother saw the news and called the struggling restaurant owners phone number on the worker's phone.
The other 2 suspects are the struggling restaurant owner (Bob) and the worker (John) who attended the party at the successful owners house. Neither of them were involved in the thieft but are suspects of the theft.
