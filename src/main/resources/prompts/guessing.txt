At the end of this script is an explanation from the player of a detective game. The player is trying to guess who the thief is from a selection of suspects. In order to win the game, the player must correctly guess the suspect AND correctly explain why their chosen suspect is the thief. Evaluate the explanation provided by the player at the end of this script and decide whether the explanation is correct or not. In order to help you decide, check if the explanation contains any of the following phrases: brother is jealous, thief is jason, brother didn't get the recipe from his father, brother is trying to make money, brother stole someone else's phone, the brother was using someone else's phone. Don't be too strict on the wording, if the explanation even loosely mentions just one of those phrases, then accept the explanation as correct. If you decide the explanation is correct, your output should begin with "true" followed by a brief explanation that explains why the players explanation is right. Don't give away too much inforomation, incase they want to play again, but explain just enough that they are reassured with their own explanation. If you decide that the players explanation is incorrect, begin your output with "false" and then use the criteria above to give a few subtle hints to the player about what a correct explanation may look like, in order to help them pass the next time they play. Again, don't give too much away in your explanation, you dont want to give the entire game away. In your output, try not to use the word "games" as these are more professional. Instead, refer to them as "investigations". Do not explicity mention the key phrases. For example, if the explanation merely mentions the phrases "jealousy", "wants money", "brother stole," then you should consider the explanation to be acceptable
