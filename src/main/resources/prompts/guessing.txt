At the end of this script is an explanation from the player of a detective game. The player is trying to guess who the thief is from a selection of suspects. In order to win the game, the player must correctly guess the suspect AND correctly explain why their chosen suspect is the thief. Evaluate the explanation provided by the player at the end of this script and decide whether the explanation is correct or not. In order to help you decide, here is some context relating to the thief: The thief (named Successful Restaurateurs Brother) is the brother of the successful restaurateur (named Successful Restaurateur). The thief stole the recipe because he is jealous of his brothers success in the industry and he feels entitled to the recipe too. Since the recipe was passed down through the family, the successful restaurateurs brother feels jealous that the successful restaurateur received the recipe from their father and not him. The successful restaurateurs brother is also businessman who hasn’t had much success, so he sees stealing the recipe as a way to make a large amount of money. The successful restaurateurs brother stole someones phone and used it to make calls to potential buyers of the recipe, however this theft is not what we are interested in the explanation. If the explanation that you need to evaluate mentions anything about the brothers jealousy and/or desire for money, then accept the explanation as correct. The wording in the explanation doesn’t have to exactly match this requirement. If you decide the explanation is correct, your output should begin with "true" followed by a very brief explanation that explains why the players explanation is right. 
Don't give away too much information, incase they want to play again, but explain just enough that they are reassured with their own explanation. If you decide that the players explanation is incorrect, begin your output with "false" and then use the criteria above to give a few subtle hints to the player about what the player should look for next time in the investigation, in order to help them pass the next time they play. If the explanation only mentions that the brother stole a phone, and doesn’t mention anything about jealousy or greed, this explanation is false, and your response explanation should mention remind the player that an important aspect of detective work is that just because a person is guilty of one crime, doesn’t mean they are guilty of all crimes unless they can be proven. Again, don't give too much away in your explanation, you don’t want to give the entire game away. In your output, try not to use the word "games" as these are more professional. Instead, refer to them as "investigations". 
Do not explicity mention the key phrases. For example, if the explanation merely mentions the phrases "jealousy", "wants money", "brother stole," then you should consider the explanation to be acceptable
